# EDEN and NeuroML


[EDEN](https://gitlab.com/neurocomputing-lab/Inferior_OliveEMC/eden) is a recently developed simulation engine which incorporates native NeuroML 2 support from the start.

Initial tests of using EDEN with NeuroML models and example code can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/EDENShowcase).
