# Mission and Aims

Computational models, based on detailed neuroanatomical and electrophysiological data, are heavily used as an aid for understanding the nervous system.
NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop a language for describing detailed models of neural systems, which will serve as a
standard data format for defining and exchanging descriptions of neuronal cell and network models.

NeuroML specifications are developed by the {ref}`NeuroML Editorial Board <neuromlorg:board>` and overseen by its {ref}`Scientific Committee <neuromlorg:ScientificCommittee>`.
NeuroML is [endorsed by the INCF](https://www.incf.org/sbp/neuroml), and is also an official [COMBINE standard](http://co.mbine.org/standards/neuroml).

The NeuroML project community develops an [XML (eXtensible Markup Language)](https://wikipedia.org/XML) based description language where [XML Schemas](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp) are used to define model specifications.
The community also develops and maintains a number of libraries (in {ref}`Python, Java and other languages <userdocs:software>`) to facilitate use of these specifications.

The **aims of the NeuroML initiative** are:

- To create specifications for an XML-based language that describes the biophysics, anatomy and network architecture of neuronal systems at multiple scales
- To facilitate the exchange of complex neuronal models between researchers, allowing for greater transparency and accessibility of models
- To promote software tools which support NeuroML and support the development of new software and databases for neural modeling
- To encourage researchers with models within the scope of NeuroML to exchange and publish their models in this format
