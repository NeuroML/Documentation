# July 2021: NeuroML tutorial at CNS*2021

```{admonition} Register for the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neurosciences (OCNS).

Register for the CNS*2021 [here](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021).
```

We will be running a half day tutorial at the 30th annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neurosciences (OCNS): [CNS*2021](https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021).

The goal of the tutorial is to teach users to: **build, visualise, analyse and simulate models using NeuroML**.

(neuromlevents:202107cns2021:why)=
## Why take part?

This tutorial is aimed at new and current NeuroML users. We will start with a quick introduction to the NeuroML standard and the associated software ecosystem, after which we will proceed to conduct hands-on sessions to show how one can build computational models with NeuroML.

## Registration

To take part in the tutorial, please register [here](https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021) for the CNS*2021 meeting.

## Pre-requisites

The sessions will make use of the NeuroML Python tools.
Please follow the documentation to install them on your system if you wish to use them locally:

- {ref}`PyNeuroML <pyneuroml>`
- {ref}`libNeuroML <libNeuroML>` 

You can also use the interactive Jupyter notebooks from the documentation if you prefer ([example](https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/NML2_examples/SingleNeuron.html)). These can be run on Binder and Google Collab in your web browser and do not require you to install anything locally on your computer.


(neuromlevents:202107cns2021:slack)=
## Slack

To aid communication with the community during (and after) the meeting, we have a **Slack channel** for NeuroML related discussions.
Please contact [Padraig Gleeson](mailto:p_DOT_gleeson_AT_ucl.ac.uk) for an invite.

You can also contact the NeuroML community using one of our other {ref}`channels <contact:chat>`.

We look forward to working with the community to drive further uptake of NeuroML compliant models and tools!
