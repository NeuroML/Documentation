# Release Process

## Overview

In general, work is carried out in the **development** branches of the [main NeuroML repositories](https://github.com/NeuroML)
and these are merged to **master** branches on a new major release, e.g. move from NeuroML v2.1 to v2.2.

A single page showing the **status of the automated test** as well as any **open Pull Requests** on all of the core NeuroML repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/NeuroML/.github/blob/main/testsheet/README.md).
