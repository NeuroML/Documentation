This section will contain information for those who wish to **contribute to the development** of the NeuroML standard and associated tools.

An overview of the NeuroML **release process** can be found {ref}`here <devdocs:release>`.

The relationship of NeuroML to a number of other tools and standards in computational neuroscience,
and the practical steps taken thus far to ensure interoperability, can be found {ref}`here <devdocs:interaction>`.

The following project Kanban boards are used to consolidate issues:

- [NeuroML](https://github.com/orgs/NeuroML/projects/4/views/1): for all repositories under the NeuroML GitHub organization
- [LEMS](https://github.com/orgs/LEMS/projects/2/views/1): for all repositories under the LEMS GitHub organization
- [NeuralEnsemble](https://github.com/orgs/NeuralEnsemble/projects/1/views/1): for all NeuroML related repositories in the Neural Ensemble GitHub organization
