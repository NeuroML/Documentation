# Overview

This section will contain information for those who wish to contribute to the development of the NeuroML standard and associated tools.

An overview of the NeuroML **release process** can be found {ref}`here <devdocs:release>`.

```{admonition} Needs work
TODO: Either we put the contribution guidelines for each tool in the repository of the tool, or we write everything here and point to it.
```

The relationship of NeuroML to a number of other tools and standards in computational neuroscience,
and the practical steps taken thus far to ensure interoperability, can be found {ref}`here <devdocs:interaction>`.
