## Open an issue beforehand!
While it will be possible to raise and discuss new issues at the workshop, it will be easier to manage and plan work/discussions if you open an issue with a description of the problem you are trying to address at: [https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/issues](https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/issues).

## Slack
To aid communication with the community during (and after) the meeting, we have a **Slack channel** for NeuroML related discussions.
Please contact [Padraig Gleeson](mailto:p_DOT_gleeson_AT_ucl.ac.uk) for an invite.

We look forward to working with the community to drive further uptake of NeuroML compliant models and tools!
