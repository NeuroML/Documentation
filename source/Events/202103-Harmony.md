:class: tip
Register for the COMBINE: HARMONY 2021 meeting [here](http://co.mbine.org/events/HARMONY_2021).
Registration is free.
```

We will be running 3 online NeuroML hackathon sessions during the upcoming [COMBINE: HARMONY 2021](http://co.mbine.org/events/HARMONY_2021) meeting on 23-25th March.
The general theme of the sessions will be: **learn to build, visualise, analyse and simulate your models using NeuroML**.

(neuromlevents:202103harmony:why)=
## Why take part?

These hackathons will give members of the neuroscience community the chance to:

- Get high level introductions to the NeuroML language and tool chain
- Meet the NeuroML core development team and editors
- Find out the latest information on which simulators/applications support NeuroML
- Open, discuss and work on issues related to converting your model to NeuroML, or supporting NeuroML in your simulator
- Learn how to share your models with the community

(neuromlevents:202103harmony:when)=
## Times and dates

All sessions will be online and take place over 3 hours (9am-noon Pacific; 12-3pm EST time; 4-7pm UK/UTC; 5-8pm CET, 9:30pm-12:30am IST; note non-standard US/EU time differences that week).
The broad focus of each of the sessions (dependent on interests of attendees) is:

- Tues 23rd March: Introduction to NeuroML, general questions about usage
- Wed 24th March: Detailed cell/conductance based models (e.g. converting channels to NeuroML)
- Thus 25th March: Abstract/point neuron networks including PyNN interactions

## Registration

To take part in the hackathon, please register [here](http://co.mbine.org/events/HARMONY_2021) for the HARMONY meeting (registration is free).
You will get sent details to access the [agenda](https://harmony2021.sched.com), which will have links to the Zoom sessions for each of the days.

(neuromlevents:202103harmony:prepare)=
## Open an issue beforehand!
While it will be possible to raise and discuss new issues at the hackathons, it will be easier to manage and plan work/discussions if you open an issue with a description of the problem you are trying to address at: [https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/issues](https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/issues).

(neuromlevents:202103harmony:slack)=
## Slack
To aid communication with the community during (and after) the meeting, we have a **Slack channel** for NeuroML related discussions.
Please contact [Padraig Gleeson](mailto:p_DOT_gleeson_AT_ucl.ac.uk) for an invite.

We look forward to working with the community to drive further uptake of NeuroML compliant models and tools!
