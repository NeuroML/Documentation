# July 2021: NeuroML tutorial at CNS*2021

```{admonition} Register for the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neurosciences (OCNS).
:class: tip
Register for the CNS*2021 [here](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021).
```

We will be running a full day tutorial at the 30th annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (OCNS): [CNS*2021](https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021).
The general theme of the sessions will be: **learn to build, visualise, analyse and simulate your models using NeuroML**.

(neuromlevents:202107cns2021:why)=
## Why take part?

These tutorials are aimed at NeuroML users.
We will start with a quick introduction to the NeuroML standard, and the software eco-system, after which we will proceed to conduct hands-on tutorials to show how one can build computational models with NeuroML.

## Times and dates

TBD

## Registration

To take part in the hackathon, please register [here](https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021) for the CNS*2021 meeting.

## Pre-requisites

The tutorials will make use of the NeuroML Python tools.
Please follow the documentation to install them on your system if you wish to use them locally:

- {ref}`PyNeuroML <pyneuroml>`
- {ref}`libNeuroML <libNeuroML>`

You can also use the Jupyter books from the documentation here if you prefer.
The run on Binder in your web browser and do not require you to install anything locally on your computer.


(neuromlevents:202107cns2021:slack)=
## Slack

To aid communication with the community during (and after) the meeting, we have a **Slack channel** for NeuroML related discussions.
Please contact [Padraig Gleeson](mailto:p_DOT_gleeson_AT_ucl.ac.uk) for an invite.

You can also contact the NeuroML community using one of our other {ref}`channels <contact:chat>`.

We look forward to working with the community to drive further uptake of NeuroML compliant models and tools!
