:class: tip
Please register for the COMBINE HARMONY 2024 meeting [here](https://co.mbine.org/author/harmony-2024/) if you are coming to our NeuroML workshop.
Registration for HARMONY is free.
```

We will be running a NeuroML  workshop during the upcoming [COMBINE network's HARMONY 2024](https://co.mbine.org/author/harmony-2024/) meeting on Tues 9th April 2024 in London, entitled:

**NeuroML hackathon: convert your neuron and network models to open, standardised, reusable formats**

This will be an opportunity for developers of models in computational neuroscience to get an introduction to the aims and structure of NeuroML, a guide to the tools available for building/converting their models to NeuroML, and to receive hands on help with expressing their models (or other published models they are interested in) in NeuroML format, making them more open, accessible and reusable.

(neuromlevents:202404harmony:prepare)=
## Open an issue beforehand!
While it will be possible to raise and discuss new issues at the workshop, it will be easier to manage and plan work/discussions if you open an issue with a description of the problem you are trying to address at: [https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/issues](https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/issues).

(neuromlevents:202404harmony:slack)=
## Slack
To aid communication with the community during (and after) the meeting, we have a **Slack channel** for NeuroML related discussions.
Please contact [Padraig Gleeson](mailto:p_DOT_gleeson_AT_ucl.ac.uk) for an invite.

We look forward to working with the community to drive further uptake of NeuroML compliant models and tools!
