We will be running a full day NeuroML tutorial during the [annual meeting of the Organisation of Computational Neuroscience, 2024](https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2024-quick) meeting in Natal, Brazil from July 20--24.

**Standardised, data-driven computational modelling with NeuroML using Open Source Brian**

Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the
properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites and the anatomical connectivity
between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviours of brain circuits in health and
disease. However, even though data and models are being made publicly available in recent
years and the use of standards such as [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://nwb.org)
and NeuroML to promote FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable
and Reusable) neuroscience is on the rise, development of data driven models remains
hampered by the difficulty of finding appropriate data and the inherent complexity involved in
their construction.

The [Open Source Brain web platform (OSB)](https://opensourcebrain.org) brings together
data, accompanying analysis tools, and computational models in a single, scalable resource.
It indexes repositories from established sources such as the [DANDI data
archive](https://dandiarchive.org), the [ModelDB model sharing
archive](https://modeldb.science), and GitHub to provide easy access to a
plethora of experimental data and models, including
a large number standardised in NWB and NeuroML formats

OSB also incorporates the NeuroML software ecosystem. NeuroML is an established
community standard and software ecosystem that enables the development of biophysically
detailed models using a declarative, simulator independent description. The software
ecosystem supports all steps of the model lifecycle and allows users to automatically
generate code and run their NeuroML models using a number of well established simulation
engines (NEURON/NetPyNE).

## Agenda

In this tutorial, attendees will learn about:

- Finding data and models on OSB
- NeuroML and its software ecosystem
- Using NeuroML models on OSB
- Building and simulating new NeuroML models constrained by the data on OSB

We will also provide assistance with advanced tasks, and discuss new features to further aid researchers.
