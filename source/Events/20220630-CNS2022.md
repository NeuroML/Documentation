# June 2022: NeuroML tutorial at CNS*2022 satellite tutorials

An online NeuroML tutorial will be held at the [CNS*2022 satellite tutorials](https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/pages/software-wg-satellite-tutorials-at-cns-2022.html).
Registration for the satellite tutorials is free, but required.

This tutorial is intended for members of the research community interested in learning more about how NeuroML and its related technologies facilitates the standardization, sharing, and collaborative development of models.
