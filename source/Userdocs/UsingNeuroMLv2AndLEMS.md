While the {ref}`tutorials <userdocs:getting_started_neuroml>` cover many of the key points of using LEMS with NeuroML, there are some points which require further explanation:

- {ref}`How are units and dimensions handled in NeuroML and LEMS? <userdocs:unitsanddimensions>`
- {ref}`How do I use a LEMS Simulation file to specify how to execute a NeuroML model? <userdocs:lemssimulation>`
- {ref}`How can I extend NeuroML model to include new types using LEMS? <userdocs:extending>`
- {ref}`What is the correct format/usage of paths and quantities in NeuroML and LEMS? <userdocs:quantitiesandpaths>`
