# Extending NeuroML with LEMS

NeuroMLv2 can be extended by defining new **ComponentTypes** in LEMS.
This is especially useful if the current set of {ref}`curated ComponentTypes <userdocs:neuromlv2>` is not sufficient for a particular modelling project.
Having definitions in LEMS allows their re-use, and these can also be submitted for inclusion to the NeuroMLv2 specification.
