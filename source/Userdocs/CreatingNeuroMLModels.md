## Writing models from scratch using Python NeuroML tools

Please see the {ref}`Getting Started with NeuroML section <userdocs:getting_started_neuroml>` for quick examples on how you can use {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyneuroml>` to create NeuroML models and run them.


(userdocs:creating_models:from_neuron)=
## Converting models from NEURON to NeuroML

Model simulations written using the NEURON simulator can be converted to NeuroML using the {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyneuroml>` API:

```{code-block} python
from pyneuroml.neuron import export_to_neuroml2
..
..

export_to_neuroml2("test.hoc", "test.morphonly.cell.nml", includeBiophysicalProperties=False)
```

```


(userdocs:creating_models:converting_conductance:github)=
### Share original model code in GitHub repo

- Make simple script with one/each cell - simple current pulse into each ([example1](https://github.com/mbezaire/ca1/blob/development/NeuroML2/olm.hoc), [example2](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/MiglioreEtAl14_OlfactoryBulb3D/blob/master/NEURON/mitral.hoc))
- Make soma only example with all channels (ideally one where channels can easily be added/commented out) - apply current pulse ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NEURON/Test_Soma.hoc) in NEURON)
- Make passive version of multi-compartmental cell with multiple locations recorded
- Make multi-compartmental cell with multiple channels and calcium dynamics, with channels specified in separate files

(userdocs:creating_models:converting_conductance:initialnml2)=
### Create an initial version in NeuroML 2

- Create LEMS*.xml ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NeuroML2/LEMS_Soma_AllNML2.xml)) with *.net.nml ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NeuroML2/Soma_AllNML2.net.nml)) and *.cell.nml ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NeuroML2/Soma_AllNML2.cell.nml)) - for a cell with only a soma (don't try to match a multi-compartmental cell with channels to the original at this first stage)
- Start off with only passive parameters (capacitance, ax resistance and 1 leak current) set; gradually add channels as in 3); apply current pulse and save soma membrane potential to file
- Ensure all `*nml` files are {ref}`valid <userdocs:validating_models>`
- Ensure `LEMS*.xml` runs with `jnml;` visually compare behaviour with original simple script from the previous section)
- Install NEURON; ensure `LEMS*.xml` runs with `jnml -neuron`
- Commit LEMS/NeuroML code to GitHub


(userdocs:creating_models:converting_conductance:convert_channels)=
### Convert channels
- Restructure/annotate/comment channel files in original model to be as clear as possible and ideally all in the same overall structure (see mod files [here](https://github.com/mbezaire/ca1/tree/development)).
- (Optional) Create a (Python) script/notebook which contains the core activation variable expressions for the channels; this can be useful to restructure/test/plot/alter units of the expressions before generating the equivalent in NeuroML (example)
- If you are using NEURON, use `pynml-modchananalysis` to generate plots of the activation variables for the channels in the mod files ([example1](https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/blob/master/examples/analyseNaMod.sh), [example2](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NEURON/analyse.sh)).
- Start from an existing similar example of an ion channel in NeuroML ([examples1](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/AllenInstituteNeuroML/tree/master/CellTypesDatabase/models/NeuroML2), [examples2](https://github.com/RokasSt/Thalamocortical/tree/master/NeuroML2/channels), [examples3](https://github.com/mbezaire/ca1/tree/development/NeuroML2/channels))
- Use `pynml-channelanalysis` to generate similar plots for your NeuroML based channels as your mod channels; these can easily be plotted for adding to your GitHub repo as summary pages ([example1](https://github.com/mbezaire/ca1/blob/development/NeuroML2/channels/channel_summary/README.md), [example2](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/MiglioreEtAl14_OlfactoryBulb3D/blob/master/NeuroML2/Channels/channel_summary/README.md)).
- Create a script to load the output of mod analysis and nml analysis and compare the outputs ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NeuroML2/compare_nml2_mods.py)).


(userdocs:creating_models:converting_conductance:compare_single_comp)=
### Compare single compartment cell with channels

- Start by comparing passive soma example in original to passive NeuroML version
- Gradually test cell with passive conductance and *each channel individually*. Plot v along with rate variables for each channel & compare how they look during current pulse ([example in NEURON](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NEURON/Test_Soma.hoc) vs [example in NeuroML](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NeuroML2/Soma_AllNML2.cell.nml) and [LEMS](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NeuroML2/LEMS_Soma_AllNML2.xml))
- Test in `jnml` first, then in Neuron with `jnml -neuron`


(userdocs:creating_models:converting_conductance:add_omv_tests)=
### Add OMV tests

```{admonition} Optional, but recommended.
:class: dropdown tip
This step is optional, but recommended.
```

- Install the [Open Source Brain Model validation framework](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/osb-model-validation) (OMV) - test on your local machine on standard examples (example: [Hay et al.](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/L5bPyrCellHayEtAl2011))
- Add OMV tests to native code ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/GranCellSolinasEtAl10/blob/master/NEURON/.test.nrnpy.omt)), e.g. test the spike times of cell when simple current pulse applied
- Add OMV tests for NeuroML version, reusing the Model Emergent Property (`*.mep`) file ([example](https://github.com/mbezaire/ca1/blob/development/NeuroML2/cells/tests/.test.sca.jnmlnrn.omt))

(userdocs:creating_models:converting_conductance:compare_multi_comp)=
### Compare multi-compartmental cell with channels

- You can export morphologies on [NeuroMorpho.org](https://neuromorpho.org) to NeuroML2 ([example](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/NeuroinformaticsTutorial/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise1_NeuroMorpho_to_OSB.md))
- If you are using NEURON, export morphology from NEURON using pyNeuroML ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/SmithEtAl2013-L23DendriticSpikes/blob/master/NeuroML2/export_nml2.py)); this will be easier if there is a hoc script with just a single cell instance as in section 1). While there is the option to use `includeBiophysicalProperties=True` and this will attempt to export the conductance densities on different groups, it may be better to consolidate these and add them afterwards using correctly named groups and the most efficient representation of conductance density to group relationships ([example](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/MiglioreEtAl14_OlfactoryBulb3D/blob/master/Python/Export/export_mitral.py)).
  - Alternatively manually add the `<channelDensity>` elements to the cell file (as [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/SmithEtAl2013-L23DendriticSpikes/blob/master/NeuroML2/L23_NoHotSpot.cell.nml#L16711)).
- As with the single compartment example, it's best to start off with the passive case, compare that to the original code (for v at multiple locations), and gradually add channels.
- Many projects on OSB were originally converted from the original format (NEURON, GENESIS, etc.) to NeuroML v1 using {ref}`neuroConstruct <userdocs:supporting:apps:neuroconstruct>` (see [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/search_custom_field?f[]=43&op[43]=~&v[43][]=neuroConstruct) for a list of these). neuroConstruct has good support for export to NeuroML v2, and this code could form the basis for your conversion. More on using neuroConstruct [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs#Using_neuroConstruct_Based_Projects) and details on conversion of models to NeuroML v1 [here](http://www.neuroconstruct.org/docs/importneuron.html#Converting+mod+file%2FGENESIS+script+channels+into+ChannelML).

(userdocs:creating_models:converting_conductance:reoptimise)=
### (Re)optimising cell models

- You can use Neurotune inside pyNeuroML to re-optimise your cell models. An example is [here](https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/blob/master/examples/tuneHHCell.py)
