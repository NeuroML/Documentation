# Testing/validating NeuroML Models

Models described in NeuroML can be run across multiple simulators, and it it essential that the activity (e.g. spike times) of the models are as close as possible across all of these independently developed platforms.

It is also important to validate that the behaviour of a given NeuroML model reproduces some recorded aspect of the biological equivalent.

TODO: Add information on using [SciUnit](https://scidash.org/sciunit.html) and [NeuronUnit](https://scidash.org/neuronunit.html) with NeuroML models.
