## NeuroML-DB: NeuroML Database

[https://neuroml-db.org/](https://neuroml-db.org/)

The NeuroML Database is a relational database that provides a means for exchanging these NeuroML model descriptions and their components.
One of its goals is to contribute to an efficient tool chain for model development using NeuroML.
This emphasis allows the database design and subsequent searching to take advantage of this specific format.
In particular, the NeuroML database allows for efficient searches over the components of models and metadata that are associated with a hierarchical NeuroML model description.

NeuroML-DB.org is developed and maintained by the [ICON Lab](https://iconlab.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu/).

To submit your NeuroML model to neuroml-db.org, please see the information on [this page](https://neuroml-db.org/about).

## Open Source Brain (v1)

[https://www.opensourcebrain.org](https://www.opensourcebrain.org)

Open Source Brain is a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species.

To add your NeuroML model to Open Source Brain, please see the information on [this page](https://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs#Creating_Your_Own_Project).
