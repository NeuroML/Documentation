![Arbor logo](../../../images/tools/arbor.png)

[Arbor](https://arbor-sim.org/) is a high performance multicompartmental neural simulation library. Addition of support for NeuroML2 and LEMS is under active development.
See [here](https://docs.arbor-sim.org/en/stable/fileformat/neuroml.html).

Example code for interactions between NeuroML models and Arbor can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/ArborShowcase).
