# NEURON and NeuroML

![NEURON logo](../../../images/tools/neuron.png)

[NEURON](http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron) is a widely used simulation environment and is one of the main target platforms for a standard facilitating exchange of neuronal models.

## Simulating NeuroML models in NEURON

{ref}`jNeuroML <jneuroml>` or {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyNeuroML>` can be used to convert NeuroML2/LEMS models to NEURON. This involves pointing at a {ref}`LEMS Simulation file <userdocs:lemssimulation>` describing what to simulate, and using the `-neuron` option:

```{code-block} console
# Simulate the model using NEURON with python/hoc/mod files generated by jNeuroML
jnml <LEMS simulation file> -neuron -run

# Simulate the model using NEURON with python/hoc/mod files generated by pyNeuroML
pynml <LEMS simulation file> -neuron -run
```

These commands generate a PyNeuron script and run it (a file ending in `_nrn.py`).
So you must have NEURON installed on your system, with its Python bindings (PyNeuron).
Skipping the `-run` flag will generate the Python script but will not run it: you can run it manually later.
Adding `-nogui` will suppress the NEURON graphical elements/menu opening and just run the model in NEURON in the background

You can also run LEMS simulations using the NEURON simulator using the {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyneuroml>` API:

```{code-block} python
from pyneuroml.pynml import run_lems_with_jneuroml_neuron

...

run_lems_with_jneuroml_neuron(lems_file_name)
```

## Using neuroConstruct

NEURON simulations can also be generated from NeuroML model components by {ref}`neuroConstruct <userdocs:supporting:apps:neuroconstruct>`, but most of this functionality is related to {ref}`NeuroML v1 <userdocs:neuromlv1>`.
