# NEURON and NeuroML

![NEURON logo](../../../images/tools/neuron.png)

[NEURON](http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron) is a widely used simulation environment and is one of the main target platforms for a standard facilitating exchange of neuronal models.

{ref}`jNeuroML <jneuroml>` can be used to convert NeuroML2/LEMS models to NEURON.

NEURON simulations can also be generated from NeuroML model components by [neuroConstruct].
