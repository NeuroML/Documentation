# NetPyNE and NeuroML

![NetPyNE logo](../../../images/tools/netpyne.png)

[NetPyNE](http://netpyne.org) is a Python package to facilitate the development, simulation, parallelization, analysis, and optimization of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator. NetPyNE can import from and export to NeuroML. NetPyNE also provides a web based [Graphical User Interface](https://github.com/MetaCell/NetPyNE-UI/wiki).

## Importing and exporting NeuroML models to/from NetPyNE

More information on running NeuroML models in NetPyNE can be found {ref}`here <userdocs:simulating_models:netpyne>`.

## Running NetPyNE on OSBv2

Building and running NetPyNE models will be a core feature of Open Source Brain v2.0. See [here](https://docs.opensourcebrain.org/OSBv2/NetPyNE.html) for more details.

## NeuroMLlite

NetPyNE is also a key target for cross simulator network creation using {ref}`NeuroMLlite <neuromllite>`. There are ongoing plans for greater alignment between formats used for network specification in NetPyNE and NeuroMLlite.
