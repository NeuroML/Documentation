The simulations and associated tools are being developed in a fully open source manner. NeuroML is being used for the description of the 302 neurons in the worm's nervous system, both for morphological description of the cells and their electrical properties.

The [c302 subproject](https://github.com/openworm/c302) in OpenWorm has the latest developments in the NeuroML version of the worm nervous system.

 Members of the OpenWorm project are also creating a general purpose neuronal simulator (for both electrical and physical simulations) which will have parallelism and native support for NeuroML built in from the start (see [Geppetto](#geppetto)).

Initial support for loading of NeuroML morphologies has been added.


(userdocs:supporting:apps:neuronland)=
### NeuronLand

![NeuronLand logo](../../images/tools/neuronland.png)

(userdocs:supporting:apps:trackem)=
### TrakEM2

![TrakEM2 logo](../../images/tools/trakem2.png)

[TrakEM2] is an ImageJ plugin for morphological data mining, three-dimensional modelling and image stitching, registration, editing and annotation. As of v0.8n, a menu item "Export - NeuroML..." gives an option to export to MorphML (the anatomy of the arbors only) or NeuroML (the whole network with anatomy and synapses), for the selected trees or all trees.

(userdocs:supporting:apps:neurovisio)=
### Neuronvisio

![Neuronvisio logo](../../images/tools/neuronvisio.png)

[Neuronvisio] is a Graphical User Interface for NEURON simulator environment with 3D capabilities. Neuronvisio makes easy to select and investigate sections' properties, it offers easy integration with matplotlib for the plotting the results.

(userdocs:supporting:other:splitneuron)=
### SplitNeuron
[SplitNeuron] is a library written in C for data structures and functions extending SQLite to simulate large-scale networks of Izhikevich Simple Model compartments.
SplitNeuron answers a fundamental issue in large-scale simulation, data transfer between storage and functional software: it uses database not only for data storage but also as simulation engine, moving computation to data rather than using storage systems only for data holding.
This choice offers more features with less code to write and a unique way of accessing data for further analysis.
Features under development include direct import and cell/network creation from NeuroML.

(userdocs:supporting:other:neuranim)=
### NeurAnim
[NeurAnim] is a research aid for computational neuroscience.
It is used to visualise and animate neural network simulations in 3D, and to render movies of these animations for use in presentations.
Networks stored in the instance based representation of NetworkML can be loaded and visualised.

(userdocs:supporting:other:cnrun)=
### CNrun
[CNrun] is a neuronal network model simulator, similar in purpose to NEURON except that individual neurons are not compartmentalised.
It was built from refactored code written by Thomas Nowotny.
It reads in network topology description from a NeuroML file, where the cell_type attribute determines the unit class, one of the in-built neuron types of CNrun (e.g. Hodgkin Huxley cell by Traub and Miles (1991), Poisson oscillator, van der Pol oscillator).

(userdocs:supporting:other:neugen)=
### NeuGen
[NeuGen] is an application in Java which is able to generate networks of synaptically connected morphologically detailed neurons, as in a cortical column.
NeuGen generates sets of neurons of the different morphological classes of the cortex, e.g. pyramidal cells and stellate neurons, and connects these networks in 3D.
The latest version of NeuGen can export the generated networks to NeuroML.
Some manual editing of the generated files is required to make them valid.
The developers have been informed of the required updates which will be incorporated soon.

(userdocs:supporting:other:morphforge)=

Edinburgh): Investigating the role of electrical coupling in small populations of interneurons in Xenopus laevis tadpoles.
Loading of morphologies in MorphML format is supported, and loading of channel descriptions from ChannelML is in progress.
Future development of morphforge will be closely aligned with the development of the multicompartmental modelling API in Python (libNeuroML).

(userdocs:supporting:other:neurotranslate)=
### NeuroTranslate
[NeuroTranslate] is a tool that translates input files between two different languages, the NCS (Neo-Cortical Simulator) input language and NeuroML format.
