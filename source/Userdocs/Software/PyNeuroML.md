# PyNeuroML

PyNeuroML is a Python package that allows users to develop NeuroML models using the Python APIs
for NeuroML and LEMS, {ref}`libNeuroML <libNeuroML>` and {ref}`pyLEMS <pylems>`, and also carry out all the functions that
{ref}`jNeuroML <jNeuroML>` provides from within Python itself.

pyNeuroML can:

- **Validate** NeuroML v1.8.1 and v2.x files
- **Simulate** most NeuroML 2 models (simulation should be specified in the [Simulation element in LEMS file](https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/blob/master/LEMSexamples/LEMS_NML2_Ex5_DetCell.xml))
- **Export** NeuroML 2 and LEMS to many formats such as Neuron, Brian, Matlab, etc.
- **Import** other languages into LEMS (e.g. SBML)
- **Visualise** internal structures in NeuroML files
