```{admonition} Suggested NeuroML tool
:class: dropdown
pyNeuroML is the suggested software tool for working with NeuroML.
It builds on {ref}`jNeuroML <jneuroml>`, {ref}`libNeuroML <libneuroml>`, and {ref}`pyLEMS <pylems>`.
```
```{admonition} Citation
:class: dropdown
Please cite Vella et al. ({cite}`Vella2014`) if you use pyNeuroML.
```

pyNeuroML is a Python package that allows you to work with NeuroML models using the Python programming language.
It includes all the API functions provided by {ref}`libNeuroML <libNeuroML>` and {ref}`pyLEMS <pylems>`, and also wraps all the functions that {ref}`jNeuroML <jNeuroML>` provides, which can therefore be used from within Python itself.

With pyNeuroML you can:

- **Create** NeuroML models and simulations
- **Validate** NeuroML v1.8.1 and v2.x files
- **Simulate** NeuroML 2 models
- **Export** NeuroML 2 and LEMS files to many formats such as Neuron, Brian, Matlab, etc.
- **Import** other languages into LEMS (e.g. SBML)
- **Visualise** NeuroML models and simulations

## Quick start

(pyneuroml:install_python_and_java)=
### Install Python and the Java Runtime Environment

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is generally pre-installed on all computers nowadays.
However, if you do not have Python installed on your system, please follow the official [installation instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python on your computer.
A number of Free/Open source Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are also available that make working with Python (even) easier.
An example list is [here](https://opensource.com/resources/python/ides).

Since pyNeuroML wraps around jNeuroML which is written in Java, you will need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
On most Linux systems [Free/Open source OpenJDK runtime environment](https://openjdk.java.net/) is already pre-installed.
You can also install Oracle's proprietary Java platform from their [download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) if you prefer.
Please refer to your operating system's documentation to install a JRE.

(pyneuroml:install_with_pip)=
### Install pyNeuroML with pip

```{admonition} Tip: Use a virtual environment
:class: tip dropdown

While using Python packages, it is suggested to use a virtual environment to isolate the software you install from each other.
Learn more about using virtual environments in Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
```

The easiest way to install the latest version of pyNeuroML is using the default Python package manager, `pip`:

```{code-block} console
pip install pyneuroml
```

By default, this will only install the minimal set of packages required to use pyNeuroML.
To use pyNeuroML with specific {ref}`supporting tools <userdocs:supporting:apps>`, please install them as required:

For {ref}`NEURON <userdocs:supporting:apps:neuron>`

```{code-block} console
pip install NEURON
```

For compiling NEURON mod files, you also need a C compiler and the make utility installed on your computer.
Additionally, to run parallel simulations the [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) libraries are also needed.
Please see the [NEURON installation documentation](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download) for more information on installing NEURON on your computer.

{ref}`Brian <userdocs:supporting:apps:brian>`, {ref}`NetPyNE <userdocs:supporting:apps:netpyne>` can also be similarly installed:

```
pip install netpyne
pip install brian2
```

For more information, please refer to their respective documentations.

(pyneuroml:install_fedora)=
### Installation on Fedora Linux

On [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) Linux systems, the [NeuroFedora](https://neuro.fedoraproject.org) community provides pyNeuroML as a package in their [extras repository](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/copr/) and can be installed using the following commands:

```{code-block} console
sudo dnf copr enable @neurofedora/neurofedora-extra
sudo dnf install python3-pyneuroml
```

Optional packages can also be installed using the default package manager:

```
sudo dnf install python3-brian2 python3-neuron neuron-devel python3-netpyne
```

MPI builds of these tools are also available in the NeuroFedora repositories.
Please see the [project documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/mpi/) on installing and using them.

(pyneuroml:docs)=
## Documentation

pyNeuroML provides a set of command line utilities along with an API to use from within Python scripts:

```{admonition} TODO!
:class: dropdown
Check that all of these have usage documentation that is viewable using the `-h` flag.
Issue filed: https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/issues/87
```

- pynml
- pynml-channelanalysis
- pynml-modchananalysis
- pynml-plotspikes
- pynml-povray
- pynml-sonata
- pynml-summary
- pynml-tune

These utilities are self-documented.
So, to learn how these utilities are to be used, run them with the `-h` flag.
For example:

```{code-block} console
pynml -h
usage: pynml [-h|--help] [<shared options>] <one of the mutually-exclusive options>

pyNeuroML v0.5.9: Python utilities for NeuroML2
    libNeuroML v0.2.54
    jNeuroML v0.10.2

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Shared options:
  These options can be added to any of the mutually-exclusive options

  -verbose              Verbose output
  -java_max_memory MAX  Java memory for jNeuroML, e.g. 400M, 2G (used in
                        -Xmx argument to java)
  -nogui                Suppress GUI,
                        i.e. show no plots, just save results
  <LEMS/NeuroML 2 file>
                        LEMS/NeuroML 2 file to process

...
```

### API documentation

Detailed API documentation for pyNeuroML can be found [here](https://pyneuroml.readthedocs.io/en/development/).

The pyNeuroML API is also self documented.
You can use Python's in-built documentation viewer `pydoc` to view the documentation for any of the package's modules and their functions:
```{code-block} console
