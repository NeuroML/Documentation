# Software and Tools

## Core NeuroML Tools

The NeuroML initiative supports **a core set of libraries** (mainly in Python and Java) to facilitate use of NeuroML models as well as adding support for the language into other applications.  

### Python based applications

For most users {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyNeuroML>` will provide all of the key functionality for building, validating, simulating, visualising, and converting NeuroML 2 and LEMS models. It builds on {ref}`libNeuroML <libNeuroML>` and {ref}`pyLEMS <pylems>` and bundles all of the functionality of {ref}`jNeuroML <jNeuroML>` to provide access to this through a Python interface.


### Java based applications

{ref}`jNeuroML <jNeuroML>` (for validating, simulating and converting NeuroML 2 models) and {ref}`jLEMS <jLEMS>` (for simulating LEMS models) are the key applications
created in Java for supporting NeuroML 2/LEMS.

### NeuroML support in other languages

There are preliminary APIs for using NeuroML in {ref}`C++ <neuromlc++>` and {ref}`MATLAB <matlab>`.

## Other NeuroML supporting applications

Many other applications, libraries and databases support NeuroML. See {ref}`here <userdocs:supporting>` for more details.
