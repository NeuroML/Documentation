# Visualising NeuroML Models

A number of the {ref}`NeuroML software tools <userdocs:software>` can be used to easily visualise models described in NeuroML.

## Get a quick summary of your model

You can get a quick summary of your NeuroML model using the  `pynml-summary` command line tool that is provided by {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyneuroml>`:

```{code-block} console
Usage:
pynml-summary <NeuroML file>
```

For example, to get a quick summary of the [Primary Auditory Cortex model by Dave Beeman](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/ACnet2/blob/master/neuroConstruct/generatedNeuroML2/MediumNet.net.nml) (see it [here on Open Source Brain](https://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/acnet2)), one can run:
```{code-block} console
pynml-summary MediumNet.net.nml

## View the 3D structure of your model

You can generate an image of the 3D structure of the NeuroML model using the `pynml` command provided by {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyneuroml>`, or using the `jnml` command provided by {ref}`jNeuroML <jneuroml>`:

```{code-block} console
Usage:
pynml -png/-svg <NeuroML file>
jnml -png/-svg <NeuroML file>
```

For example, to generate a PNG image of the Auditory Cortex model used above, we can use (use `-svg` to generate a vectorised SVG image instead of a PNG):

```{code-block} console
pynml -png MediumNet.net.nml
```

This generates the following image showing different views of the network :

```{figure} ../images/Acnet-medium.net.png
:alt: Graphical view of the Auditory Cortex model generated with pynml
:align: center
:scale: 20 %

Graphical view of the Auditory Cortex model generated with pynml
```

```{admonition} Open Source Brain uses NeuroML.
:class: tip
The [Open Source Brain platform](https://www.opensourcebrain.org) generates the interactive visualisations from NeuroML sources.
See the Auditory Cortex model on Open Source Brain [here](https://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/acnet2).
```


(userdoc:visualising_models:graph)=
## View the connectivity graph of your model

```{admonition} Use levels to generate connectivity graphs with different levels of detail.
:class: tip dropdown

Positive values for levels will generate figures at the population level, while negative values will generate them at the level of cells.
```

You can generate an image of the 3D structure of the NeuroML model using `pynml`:

```{code-block} console
Usage:
pynml <NeuroML file> -graph <level, engine> 
```

For example, to generate a PNG image of the Auditory Cortex model used above, we can use:

```{code-block} console
pynml MediumNet.net.nml -graph 1d
```

This generates the following image showing different views of the network :

```{figure} ../images/Acnet-medium-graph-level1.png
:alt: Level 1 network graph generated by pynml
:align: center

Level 1 network graph generated by pynml
```

You can modify the level of detail included in the graph by using different values of levels.
For example, this command generates a level 5 graph:

```{code-block} console
pynml MediumNet.net.nml -graph 5d
```

```{figure} ../images/Acnet-medium-graph-level5.png
:alt: Level 5 network graph generated by pynml
:align: center
:scale: 60 %

Level 5 network graph generated by pynml
```

(userdoc:visualising_models:matrix)=
## View the connectivity matrices of the model

You can generate the connectivity matrices of projections between neuronal populations of the NeuroML model using `pynml`:

```{code-block} console
Usage:
pynml <NeuroML file> -matrix <level>
```

For example, to generate a PNG image of the connectivity matrices in the Auditory Cortex model used above, we can use:

```{code-block} console
pynml MediumNet.net.nml -matrix 1
```

This generates the following images showing different views of the connectivity matrices in the network :

<div class="container-fluid">
<div class="row my-2 py-2">
<div class="col-sm-6 px-2">

```{image} ../images/Acnet-matrix-1.png

(userdoc:visualising_models:lemsgraph)=
## View graph of the simulation instance of the model

When you have created a simulation instance of the NeuroML model using LEMS, you can also visualise this using `pynml` or `jnml`:

```{code-block} console
Usage:
pynml <LEMS simulation file> -lems-graph
jnml <LEMS simulation file> -lems-graph
```

For example, to generate the LEMS graph for the {ref}`Izhikevich neuron network example <userdocs:gettingstarted:izhikevichnetwork>`, we will use:

```{code-block} console
jnml LEMS_example_izhikevich2007network_sim.xml -lems-graph
```
will generate:
```{figure} ../Userdocs/NML2_examples/LEMS_example_izhikevich2007network_sim.png
:alt: Model summary graph generated using jnml.
:align: center
:scale: 50%

A summary graph of the model generated using jnml.
```

Note that the `-lems-graph` option does not take options for levels of detail.
It shows all the details of the simulation instance, and so is better suited for simpler models rather than detailed conductance based network models.
For example, for the Auditory Cortex model, {download}`this <../images/Acnet-LEMS.png>` very very detailed image is generated (please click to open: it is too large to display in the page).
