# Validating NeuroML Models
```{admonition} Validate NeuroML 2 files before using them.
:class: tip
It is good practice to validate NeuroML 2 files to check them for correctness before using them.
```

Models described in NeuroML must adhere to the NeuroML {ref}`specification <userdocs:specification>`.
This allows all NeuroML models to be checked for correctness: **validation**.
There are a number of ways of **validating** NeuroML model files.

## Using the command line tools

Both `pynml` (provided by {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyneuroml>`) and `jnml` (provided by {ref}`jNeuroML <jneuroml>`) can validate individual NeuroML files:

```{code-block} console
Usage:

# For NeuroML 2
jnml -validate <NML file(s)>
pynml <NML file(s)> -validate

# For NeuroML 1 (deprecated)
jnml -validatev1 <NML file>
pynml <NML file(s)> -validatev1
```

## Using the Python API

The {ref}`pyNeuroML <pyneuroml>` Python API provides a number of methods to validate NeuroML 2 files.
The first is the aptly named `validate_neuroml2` function:

```{code-block} python

from pyneuroml.pynml import validate_neuroml2

...

validate_neuroml2(nml_filename)
```
Similarly, the `validate_neuroml1` function can be used to validate NeuroML v1 files.

If you are loading NeuroML files into your Python script, the `read_neuroml2_file` function also includes validation:

```{code-block} python

from pyneuroml.pynml import read_neuroml2_file


....


read_neuroml2_file(nml_filename, include_includes=True, check_validity_pre_include=True)
```

This will read (load) the provided NeuroML 2 file and all the files that are recursively included by it, and validate them all while it loads them.
