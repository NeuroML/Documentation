# Getting started with NeuroML

Here, we show a very small NeuroML file, and walk the reader through it.
We don't talk about LEMS here or go into other details about simulators and other tools.
We just go through the file and give the reader an idea of what NeuroML does.

This page leads to the next one, on the specification.
