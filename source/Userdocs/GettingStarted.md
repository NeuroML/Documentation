# Getting started with NeuroML

The best way to understand NeuroML is to work through NeuroML examples to see how they are constructed and what they can do.
We present below a set of step-by-step guides to illustrate how models are written and simulated using NeuroML.

You do not need to install any software on your computers to run many of the examples above. These examples are followed by a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) for you to experiment with inside your browser ({ref}`more info <userdocs:usage:jupyterbooks>`).
