# Outreach and training

The NeuroML community has a strong record of participating in training and outreach activities.
Information on tutorials and workshops can be seen in the Events pages.

## Google summer of Code

The NeuroML community participates annually in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) under the [INCF](https://incf.org) organisation.
Projects are centred around the standardisation of published models in NeuroML to make these standardised versions available on the [Open Source Brain](https://opensourcebrain.org) platform and improving the NeuroML tools wherever possible.

### 2025

This round of Google Summer of Code is currently in progress.
We are participating under the [INCF](https://incf.org/blog/call-project-ideas-and-mentors-gsoc-2025).

We are looking for candidates with prior experience in neuroscience/computational neuroscience to work on our project:

"Developing standardised biophysically detailed neuronal circuit models using NeuroML/PyNN/Open Source Brain"

More information can be found [here in the ideas list (#12)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7U4nYFbVbZuIUw_2bB89YASj-ra26hRNtG2a20Gjlw/edit?usp=sharing).
