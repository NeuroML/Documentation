# Outreach and training

The NeuroML community has a strong record of participating in training and outreach activities.
Information on tutorials and workshops can be seen in the Events pages.

## Google summer of Code

The NeuroML community participates annually in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) under the [INCF](https://incf.org) organisation.
Projects are centred around the standardisation of published models in NeuroML to make these standardised versions available on the [Open Source Brain](https://opensourcebrain.org) platform and improving the NeuroML tools wherever possible.
