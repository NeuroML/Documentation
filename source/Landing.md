Welcome to NeuroML documentation
================================

Computational models, based on detailed neuroanatomical and electrophysiological data, are heavily used as an aid for understanding the function of the nervous system.
NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop a language for describing detailed models of neural systems.
NeuroML develops a description language to provide a common data format for defining and exchanging descriptions of neuronal cell and network models.

On this website, you will find documentation on using, NeuroML, developing with NeuroML, its specifications, and the community that maintains it.
